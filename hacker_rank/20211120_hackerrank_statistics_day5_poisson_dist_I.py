# Objective
# In this challenge, we learn about Poisson distributions.

# Task
# A random variable, X, follows Poisson distribution with mean of 2.5. 
# Find the probability with which the random variable X is equal to 5.

# Input Format
# The first line contains 's mean. The second line contains the value we want the probability for:

# Output Format
# Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).
