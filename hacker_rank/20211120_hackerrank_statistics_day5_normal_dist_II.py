# Objective
# In this challenge, we go further with normal distributions.

# Task
# The final grades for a Physics exam taken by a large group of students have a mean of u=70 and a standard deviation of s=10. 
# If we can approximate the distribution of these grades by a normal distribution, what percentage of the students:

# Scored higher than 80 (i.e., have a grade > 80)?
# Passed the test (i.e., have a grade >= 60)?
# Failed the test (i.e., have a grade < 80)?

# Find and print the answer to each question on a new line, rounded to a scale of 2 decimal places.

# Input Format
# There are 3 lines of input (shown below):
# The first line contains 2 space-separated values denoting the respective mean and standard deviation for the exam. 
# The second line contains the number associated with question 1. 
# The third line contains the pass/fail threshold number associated with questions 2 and 3.

# Output Format
# There are three lines of output. Your answers must be rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format):

# On the first line, print the answer to question 1.
# On the second line, print the answer to question 2.
# On the third line, print the answer to question 3.
