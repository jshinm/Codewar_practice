# Objective
# In this challenge, we go further with binomial distributions. 

# Task
# A manufacturer of metal pistons finds that, on average, 12% of the pistons 
# they manufacture are rejected because they are incorrectly sized. 
# What is the probability that a batch of 10 pistons will contain:

# No more than 2 rejects?
# At least 2 rejects?

# Input Format
# A single line containing the following values (denoting the respective 
# percentage of defective pistons and the size of the current batch of pistons):

# Output Format
# Print the answer to each question on its own line:
# The first line should contain the probability that a batch of  pistons will contain no more than  rejects.
# The second line should contain the probability that a batch of  pistons will contain at least  rejects.
# Round both of your answers to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).
