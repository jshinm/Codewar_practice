# Objective
# In this challenge, we practice solving problems based on the Central Limit Theorem.

# Task
# A large elevator can transport a maximum of 9800 pounds. 
# Suppose a load of cargo containing 49 boxes must be transported via the elevator.
# The box weight of this type of cargo follows a distribution with a mean of 205 pounds and a standard deviation of 15 pounds. 
# Based on this information, what is the probability that all 49 boxes can be safely loaded into the freight elevator and transported?

# The first line contains the maximum weight the elevator can transport. 
# The second line contains the number of boxes in the cargo. 
# The third line contains the mean weight of a cargo box, 
# and the fourth line contains its standard deviation.

# Output Format
# Print the probability that the elevator can successfully transport all 49 boxes, 
# rounded to a scale of 4 decimal places (i.e., 1.2345 format).
