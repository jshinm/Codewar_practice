# Objective
# In this challenge, we go further with geometric distributions.

# Task
# The probability that a machine produces a defective product is 1/3. 
# What is the probability that the 1st defect is found during the first 5 inspections?

# Input Format
# The first line contains the respective space-separated numerator and denominator 
# for the probability of a defect, and the second line contains the inspection 
# we want the probability of the first defect being discovered by:

# Output Format
# Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).
