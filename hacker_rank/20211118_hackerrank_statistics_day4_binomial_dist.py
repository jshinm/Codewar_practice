# Objective
# In this challenge, we learn about binomial distributions. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials!

# Task
# The ratio of boys to girls for babies born in Russia is 1.09:1. 
# If there is 1 child born per birth, what proportion of Russian families with exactly 6 children will have at least 3 boys?

# Write a program to compute the answer using the above parameters. 
# Then print your result, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).

# Input Format
# A single line containing the following values:
# 1.09 1

# If you do not wish to read this information from stdin, you can hard-code it into your program.

# Output Format
# Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of  decimal places (i.e.,  format).
