# Objective
# In this challenge, we learn about normal distributions.

# Task
# In a certain plant, the time taken to assemble a car is a random variable, X, 
# having a normal distribution with a mean of 20 hours and a standard deviation of 2 hours. 
# What is the probability that a car can be assembled at this plant in:

# Less than 19.5 hours?
# Between 20 and 22 hours?

# Input Format
# The first line contains 2 space-separated values denoting the respective mean and standard deviation for X. 
# The second line contains the number associated with question 1. 
# The third line contains 2 space-separated values describing the respective lower and upper range boundaries for question 2.

# Output Format
# There are two lines of output. Your answers must be rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format):

# On the first line, print the answer to question 1 (i.e., the probability that a car can be assembled in less than 19.5 hours).
# On the second line, print the answer to question 2 (i.e., the probability that a car can be assembled in between 20 to 22 hours).
