# Objective
# In this challenge, we learn about geometric distributions.

# Task
# The probability that a machine produces a defective product is 1/3. 
# What is the probability that the 1st defect occurs the 5st item produced?

# Input Format
# The first line contains the respective space-separated numerator 
# and denominator for the probability of a defect, and the second 
# line contains the inspection we want the probability of being the first defect for:

# Output Format
# Print a single line denoting the answer, rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format).
