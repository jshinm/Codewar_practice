# Objective
# In this challenge, we go further with Poisson distributions.

# Task
# The manager of a industrial plant is planning to buy a machine of either type A or type B. For each dayâ€™s operation:

# The number of repairs, X, that machine A needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 0.88. The daily cost of operating A is C_A=160+40X^2.
# The number of repairs, Y, that machine B needs is a Poisson random variable with mean 1.55. The daily cost of operating B is C_B=128+40Y^2.
# Assume that the repairs take a negligible amount of time and the machines are maintained nightly 
# to ensure that they operate like new at the start of each day. 
# Find and print the expected daily cost for each machine.

# Input Format
# A single line comprised of 2 space-separated values denoting the respective means for A and B:

# Output Format
# There are two lines of output. Your answers must be rounded to a scale of 3 decimal places (i.e., 1.234 format):

# On the first line, print the expected daily cost of machine A.
# On the second line, print the expected daily cost of machine B.
